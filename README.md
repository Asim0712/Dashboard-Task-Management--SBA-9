# Task Dashboard Management 
## React + TypeScript + Vite + Javascript + Tailwind



## Overview
In this assessment, you will apply the skills you have developed throughout your React training to build a functional, real-world dashboard application. This project will test your understanding of React components, state management, TypeScript integration, form handling, and component composition.

You will create a Task Management Dashboard using React and TypeScript. The final deliverable will include a GitHub repository with your project and a written reflection on your approach and the challenges you faced.
